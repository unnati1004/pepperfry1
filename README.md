# What did I Learn

- By end of this project, I am able to learn how effective work can be done as a team when ideas are trajected in multiple spectrums.

- The coordination while presenting the project was a new experience for all the members of the team which was fun driven as well as professional learning.

- Effective learning involves how we were able to suggest constructive feedback on each other’s work and debug before we present our project.
